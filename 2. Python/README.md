# Python – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This folder contains the Python notebook used for **data preparation and exploratory analysis** as part of the end-to-end business analytics workflow.

The notebook focuses on **understanding the data, validating business logic, and deriving insights**, rather than on building production pipelines or complex models.

## Contents

- `eda_business_analysis.ipynb`  
  Performs exploratory data analysis on transactional data after combining branch, customer, and transaction datasets.

---

## Purpose of the Analysis

The Python EDA is used to:
- Combine data from multiple sources using joins  
- Validate results obtained from SQL queries  
- Analyze trends, distributions, and patterns  
- Support insights later visualized in Power BI  

The analysis is written in a **clear, business-oriented style**, with explanations included directly within the notebook.

---

## How to Use

1. Ensure the datasets are available in the folder.
2. Open `eda_business_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

No additional configuration is required beyond standard Python data analysis libraries.

## Notes

- The notebook intentionally prioritizes **readability and interpretability** over technical optimization.
- Visualizations are used only where they add analytical value.
- The same business questions explored here are reflected in the SQL scripts and Power BI dashboard.
